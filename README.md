# Projects Board

This repository contains the code for the Projects Board website.

Projects Board is a web application that showcases projects that are seeking collaborators.
Developers looking to join forces can browse the listed projects, read the details and
tech stack, and reach out to the contact person to get started. Developers who already have
a project or idea, can share it to find collaborators.

The first version is a proof of concept, and it's intentianlly as simple as possible, with the
intention that it serves as a starting point for a more featureful website. The backend uses
PHP with plain HTML and CSS on the front end.

Eventhough frameworks have not been used for this version, we plan to migrate it to Laravel for
the backend and React for the front end.

# Contributing

This is a community driven project. Any feedback received is much appreciated and will be considered
for future releases. You can use Github's issues to report bugs or feature request.

This project is also open to pull requests, and developers from all levels and backgrounds are welcome to
contribute.

If you're wanting to learn Laravel or React, this might be a way to do so while contributing to a real-world project.
We take this project as an opportunity to learn, share knowledge, and improve our skills in a collaborative environment.
