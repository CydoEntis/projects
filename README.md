# WebDev Projects

This repository contains the code for the projects application.
It should allow us to share projects or ideas we want to collaborate and allow us to get in touch.

The first version of the application should allow us to list projects with a description and tech stack.
It should also allow us to add contact information, ideally this would be a Discord username.

It is as simple as it gets, the idea is that this is also a project anyone in the community can participate.
